          My name is Michael Roesinger. I'm a Full-Stack web developer and life
          long problem solver. Emerging from a career in German automobile
          restoration, I've shifted gears into the world of Software
          Engineering. I was introduced to coding while visiting my best friend
          from music school in Berlin, Germany. Having honed my engineering
          skills in the automotive industry, my transition to the tech world has
          been seamless. Everything I loved about diagnosing fuel injection
          systems, tracing circuits, and repairing faulty electronics is all
          neatly encompassed in the process of debugging. Here's to trading
          dirty hands for clean code! üçª
