          Full stack web developer and life long problem solver. Emerging from a
          career in German automobile restoration, I've shifted gears into the
          world of Software Engineering. I was introduced to coding while
          visiting my best friend from music school in Berlin, Germany. Having
          honed my engineering skills in the automotive industry, my transition
          to the tech world has been seamless. Everything I loved about,
          diagnosing fuel injection systems, tracing circuits, and repairing
          faulty electronics is all neatly encompassed in the process of
          debugging. Here's to trading dirty hands for clean code! üçª
